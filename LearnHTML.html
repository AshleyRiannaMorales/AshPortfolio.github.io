        Learning HTML is quite challenging; it's new and so unlike of what we've learned for the past year in BSIT.
        It has a lot of tags that we need to remember, concepts that we need to keep in mind, and it requires sense
        of creativity to be able to bring to life the webpage that we envision.

        For me, the hardest thing in HTML would be creating tables. It is confusing since the tags could be interchanged,
        which may lead to placing the data on the wrong cell in the table. However, amidst the confusion and challenge, 
        learning HTML was fun. It is a breath of fresh air, and I enjoy it because it encourages me to be creative and 
        it teaches me to be more mindful and careful with what I code, considering that HTML has a lot of tags and you
        need to create a properly structured code to bring your webpage to life.
