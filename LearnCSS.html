        Personally, learning CSS is very difficult as compared to learning HTML since it requires patience and countless of 
        trial-and-error. It demands you not only to be creative, but also to be meticulous with your code and design.

        For me, the hardest thing in CSS would be figuring out the measurements of the padding and margin aspects of elements
        in order to fully achieve an overall look that is visually pleasing and appealing. However, even though CSS proves to be
        a great challenge, it is still fun to play around the measurements of elements and trying out various designs to bring
        a cohesive look to the webpage. Just like HTML, CSS encourages me to be creative and to put into reality everything
        that I imagine.
